CSS Size
We've seen various units in CSS so far used for many different purposes; we did hit and trial to find the correct dimensions of that unit for our website.

But now let's understand how units work in CSS.

Absolute Units
cm - centimetres (1 cm = 37.8 px)
mm - millimetres
in - inches (1 in = 96 px = 2.54cm)
pt - points (1pt = 1/72th of 1 in)
pc - picas (1pc = 1/6th of 1 in)
px - pixel (1px = 1/96th of 1 in)
Generally, we only use pixels to set dimensions of an element.

Relative Units
em - Relative to the font size of the parent element. Eg: 5em means the size would be 5 times the current font size.
ex - Relative to X height of the existing font
ch - Relative to the width/radius of the character “0”.
rem - Relative to the font size of the root element.
vw - Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport. (Viewport is the area of the website visible to the user.)
vh - Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
% - Relative to the parent element’s size.
Apart from this, some of the other metrics used in CSS are:

Opacity: Ranges from 0 to 1
RGB & RGBA values: 0 to 255
HSL & HSLA values: 0 to 360# Web-Development-Day-22
